# Movie Opinion

Our project introduces a revolutionary movie rating system where the audience's voice truly matters. Users can leave comments on movies, and an advanced model evaluates these comments to determine their sentimentâ€”positive or negative. The collective sentiment from these comments directly influences the movie's overall rating, ensuring that ratings are a true reflection of public opinion. This dynamic approach democratizes movie reviews, making ratings more accurate and representative of the audience's views.
